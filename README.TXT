These are quick hacks (which always take longer than one expects) that
illustrate that the algorithm for minimum convex decomposition of Keil
and Snoeyink (CCCG 98) can actually be implemented in O(n r^2) time
and space.

MCD	Minimum convex decomposition of a simple polygon
MWT	Minimum weight triangulation of a simple polygon
VPTest	Visibility algorithm tester

CompGeom/ geometry classes

These can run as standalone (e.g. java MCD) or as applets from 
the .html files.
